# FindFido

## A profile for your pets to assist in finding them if they get lost.

###App Name : FindFido

The functionality of this app will feature a profile of your pet and allow the user to send notifications when or if your pet is lost.
+ Main Profile: upload photo of pet, name of pet, fun facts.
+ Description of pet: to include breed, color, temperament of animal (friendly or not) 
+ Contact Info: Owner name, phone number, and address. (Can remain hidden until needed.)
+ Google Maps: Map accessible so owner can drop pin where animal was last seen.
+ Notification Capable: Push notifications to friends or people in the area that have the app to help find animal.
+ Maybe be accessible to animal shelters and vet offices so they can notify the owner if their animal is picked up.

Pet owners would find this app useful and help ease their mind that there is an extended community to help find their pets if gone missing.

This app would require some internet access, especially to access maps when dropping a pin. But notifications could be sent using the app.

This app will use data from accessing location for the map and maybe for the shelters.

*** This app can eventually be used for children too. It could be an extension of the Amber Alert.
*** Without getting to overextended, this app might also be able to tied into an extension and have access to shelters and vets details TBD.
