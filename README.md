# Green Print

## A profile to help determine the users carbon footprint and how to decrease it.

### App Name : Green Print

The functionality of this app will feature a profile of the user and a score of their carbon footprint. The user would then able to see their progression of decreasing their score by submitting daily/weekly tasks like using the air conditioner few days out of the year or riding their bicycle to work. The user would then be able to notify friends of their progress. 
This app will need some internet to access the API to process the initial survey, some updates and accessing a potential online community. But notifications could be sent using the app and most tips could be held within the app.
