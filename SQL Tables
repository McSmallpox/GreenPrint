# SQL Tables
My SQL tables will be based off the data calculations of energy consumption and their usage.I will potentially need another separate collection of the usage equivalency and their carbon counteraction.My SQL database will consist of six tables: Household Vehicles, Home Energy, Waste, On the Road, At Home, and the Conversion Factors and Constants.Each will have columns of: Description of facto, Value, the Unit of Production, and the EPA Assumptions used to make the calculations.The Conversion Factors and Constants table will use information from each of the other table to make the calculations. If, I can get a properly formatted usage equivalency  database, It will have a table using the data from the Conversion Factors.This table would need to be separated by type of usage output and then the equivalency of the same type resource being saved. Meaning, not driving can only return a decrease of carbon emissions or recycling would only be able to return values in saved trees, etc.
